# Bank Price Tracker
- Ever had your bank value go up by tens, if not hundreds of millions but don't want to figure out what caused the biggest change?
- This plugin will show you what changes have happened to each tradeable item in your bank in an easy to read table.
- You can adjust the table to show small/medium/large and adjust the difference over time from 30 minutes to a month.
- You can also click each of the columns to sort alphabetically, by current value or by most profitable/biggest loss.
